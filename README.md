# 🌐 My Portfolio

Every developer has a story.  
This is mine — told through code, design, and a little bit of curiosity.

---

## ✨ The Beginning
It started as a blank screen.  
I wanted a place that wasn’t just a list of projects, but a digital home that reflects who I am as a developer and creator.  

---

## 🛠️ Building Blocks
I chose tools that feel right for me:
- **HTML + Bootstrap CSS** for clean design and speed.
- **JavaScript** for flexibility.
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment.

Every piece of this project was picked not just for functionality, but for how it represents my style of work: **modern, minimal, and scalable**.

## 🚀 The Journey
- ✅ First commit: a rough sketch of my idea.  
- 🎨 Redesigned with Tailwind to keep it sleek and responsive.  
- 🌍 Deployed live for the world to see.  
- ⚡ Continuously updated as my skills grow.
